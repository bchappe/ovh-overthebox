# ovh-overthebox
monitoring template

This is my first project. Only for monitoring the solution of the aggregation of the provider OVH in SNMP. 

System is based on debian 8 x64

- Avalable for Nagios IV and the little friend (Shinken)...
- We use only a SNMP because when your box is automaticly update by OVH (1 or 2 per Month), your lost the custom package
